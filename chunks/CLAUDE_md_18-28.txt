- **File Navigation**: A user can navigate through files and directories in a file explorer, restricted to a given root directory (chroot mode) to prevent leaving the allowed path.
- **Progress Highlighting**: The explorer indicates each file’s chunking progress with color highlights – partially chunked files in yellow, mostly chunked in orange, and fully chunked in green for quick visual status.
- **Text Viewing**: A user can open a selected text file in a viewer pane and scroll through its content (using keyboard arrows/Vim keys for up/down, or other typical scrolling keys).
- **Save Chunks**: Pressing `S` will save the currently highlighted lines as a chunk file in a designated storage directory. Each saved chunk is written to disk persistently.
- **Highlight Saved Chunks**: Once saved, the chunked lines in the viewer are highlighted (e.g., in orange) to indicate they have been chunked. This helps avoid re-selecting the same text. The file’s entry in the explorer also updates its color if the new chunk changes its overall chunking status.
- **Undo Last Chunk**: Pressing `R` removes the last saved chunk (an undo feature for one step). The chunk file is deleted, and the file’s highlights/progress are updated. (As a stretch goal, pressing `Shift+R` could redo the removed chunk.)
- **Real-time Updates**: The application watches the filesystem in real time. If chunk files or source files are added, removed, or changed outside the application, it detects these changes and updates the UI highlights and file list immediately.
- **Configurable Settings**: A configuration allows setting the chunk storage directory path and a maximum chunk size. Stretch goals: make keybindings (like the keys for save/undo) and color schemes configurable to suit user preferences.
