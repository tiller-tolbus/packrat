# Abstract

This project is a terminal user interface (TUI) application for interactively chunking text files. The tool lets users split large text files into smaller chunks by selecting text in a console UI and saving those selections as separate files. It provides a file explorer and text viewer with visual cues to track chunking progress. Key user stories and requirements include:

- **File Navigation**: A user can navigate through files and directories in a file explorer, restricted to a given root directory (chroot mode) to prevent leaving the allowed path.
- **Progress Highlighting**: The explorer indicates each file’s chunking progress with color highlights – partially chunked files in yellow, mostly chunked in orange, and fully chunked in green for quick visual status.
- **Text Viewing**: A user can open a selected text file in a viewer pane and scroll through its content (using keyboard arrows/Vim keys for up/down, or other typical scrolling keys).
- **Text Selection**: A user can toggle selection mode by pressing **Space**; when selection mode is active, moving the cursor up or down highlights the selected lines to be chunked.  
- **Save Chunks**: Pressing `S` will save the currently highlighted lines as a chunk file in a designated storage directory. Each saved chunk is written to disk persistently.
- **Highlight Saved Chunks**: Once saved, the chunked lines in the viewer are highlighted (e.g., in orange) to indicate they have been chunked. This helps avoid re-selecting the same text. The file’s entry in the explorer also updates its color if the new chunk changes its overall chunking status.
- **Undo Last Chunk**: Pressing `R` removes the last saved chunk (an undo feature for one step). The chunk file is deleted, and the file’s highlights/progress are updated. (As a stretch goal, pressing `Shift+R` could redo the removed chunk.)
